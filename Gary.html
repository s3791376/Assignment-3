							<p>
								My name is Maximillian Arik Hadenfeld-Hunt, but you can call me Gary for short.
								I was born in Sydney, Australia. Although i've spent the majority of my life in Melbourne.
							<p>
								Since I was a kid I had always been around technology, I got an xbox when I was 4 and a computer when I was 6.
								When I got my computer, I spent a lot of time playing games on Cartoon Network's old website; And then when I was 8
								I got a copy of Warcraft 3, after which I spent many hours developing custom maps and downloading resources off of mod
								distribution sites. When DoTA came out for Warcraft 3 I used to travel to my local library to participate in local tournaments
								though I never really went any far with it. I remember that being a big drive in my interest towards IT specifically in making games.
							<p>
								Later in my life when I was 16 I signed up for a VET course in IT with a focus on game construction and Java. However it is
								through this course that I realised Game Design was more of a hobby than anything else for me and thus my interest shifted
								more towards Software Development in general compared to specifically Game Design. I'm currently enrolled in the
								Computing Studies course at RMIT, which I hope to translate to a fruitful IT career in the future.
							</p>
							<p>
								My ideal job is working as a Software Engineer.
								This position entails full time work at a Software Development house, where through a combination of experience with cloud platforms,
								knowledge of industrial languages such as Java, Python C# and knowledge of functional languages like Scala or Haskell.
								I find this career path appealing as it requires the skills I intend to learn and allows for
								creativity and ingenuity when it comes to approaching work projects.
