							<p>The questions that was given me I honestly answered and I feel that the results truly show who I am as a person, there might be few areas where I may require to change yet these minor changes won’t affect me as a person, my characteristics that led me to this moment will keep evolving and that the results is just an indication of who I am as a person.</p>
							<p>The results show that I am slightly extrovert over introvert meaning I do understand that there are others around me and acknowledge that they are there to take part within a team, my opinions may be based on feelings yet they will be brought forward to the team as a form of understanding and hope that with that opinion it can be developed and shaped to a common understanding with the team. My openness towards the team will greatly benefit with decision making as I’ll be happy to take and receive critic and opinions of others. My agreeableness shows how I would put myself second and others first to listen and understand, afterwards I can present my ideas based upon others opinions and mine.</p>
							<p> When forming a team or being a part of a team, I will look at what I need to adapt with to have harmony between the team members as everyone would have different results. With these results it shows how I can adapt myself towards a team and also make myself heard, contributing to opinions and developing ideas as a team. I believe that myself as a person will provide greatly with a team and If i had to choose i’d choose people that would also be able to adapt to my personally as an extrovert, being open and also agreeing with others opinions. </p>
