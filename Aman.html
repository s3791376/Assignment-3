							<h4> About me </h4>
							<p>My name is Aman Kumar, I am an Indian Migrant from Fiji. I was born in Papua New Guinea on May the 11th 2000. I migrated to Australia in 2001 and have grown up here, and as such only speak English. I attended school in the western suburbs of Melbourne graduating from year 12 from Lakeview Senior College. Whilst in highschool I was fortunate enough to complete a VET in schools course where I recived my Certificate III in Information Digital Media and Technology. I've been interested in IT from a very young age creating "backups" of games for my Nintendo DS' flashcart when I was 9 years old, to even building my own desktop at 14. My favourite hobby would definitely be video games and gaming, specifically playing MOBA's such as League of Legends, DoTA and HoTS. As of current I have no professional IT experience. <br> Student Number: S3785534 <br> Student Email: S3785534@student.rmit.edu.au <br> Website: <a href="https://s3785534.github.io/"> S3785534.github.io </a> </p>
							<h4> My Ideal Job </h4>
							<p>My ideal job would be software development/engineering. Software development requires me to create flexible software solutions for numerous different applications. Which hence entails variety in the line of work, no two projects would be the same and each would bring new challenges which would require adapting. Solving these challenges would guarantee that work is never stale and grant me job satisfaction each time I completed these tasks.</p>
							<h4> Career Plans </h4>
							<p> Software development is quite similar to software engineering, a field in which I and a couple of my peers are currently striving to become qualified for. Namely, it entails creating applications for a variety of different needs, albeit most of the time corporate. However, there are a few points of difference; Software Engineering seems to be more focused on the backend of things whilst software development seems to be more holistic in a sense, encapsulating both development aspects of the frontend and backend cycles. In comparing with the rest of my peers although our final professions differ greatly they require similar paths in gaining certification, with the main point of difference being where each of us would like to specialise in. For e.g where I, Gary and Harry would study various programming subjects during our time at university, Dylan would definitely study subjects such as Cloud Computing and other related subjects. Overall whilst the
							positions we are all educating ourselves for differ, the way in which each of us are getting there is ultimately quite similar.
