							<h1>Team Member Profile - Raymond</h1>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic13.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<h3>Background Information</h3>
							<p>I was born in Australia, dispite being raised in a Chinese culture. Attended both Primary and Secondary of stage of education and now started my first year of university studying the Bachelor of Information Technology. I can speak English, many variations of Chinese and a small amount of other languages too.</p>
							<p>An interesting fact of mine, would include having the ability to lead different teams with a common goal. Which has been of benefit in group-related tasks. I don't own any pets, and a hobby may include troubleshooting. An IT interest would include something along the lines of System admin and Network Admin, interacting with both network systems and handling the maintenance, installation etc of business systems.</p>
							<p>I have very little IT Experience. Other than self-learning Windows Server 2012, and using learning little about Cisco CCNA using the emulation software GNS3. Furthermore, I completed holiday work experience in an IT company helping maintain and mmanage business systems.
							<p>An ideal job may include becoming a Systems Engineer, someone who is responsible for a network, maintains and installs network systems, and communicates with customers to provide a reasonable / better solution.</p>
							<p>For this particular job, amongst many criteria, it is looks for skills such as, understanding DDOS attacks, having the ability to work with a diverse level of Switching and Routing such as, Juniper, Cisco and Dell. ensuring the customer is at the first priority and maintaining their steady connection (broad), as well as having strong problem solving / troubleshooting skills with a focus on root cause analysis and remediation, while having a strong understanding of the user. Having strong communication skills, and strong team leadership skills, providing expert support, analysis and research into complex business and technology problems, and having a fast aptitude in all situations requiring high levels of concentration.
							<p>The group worked as required during Assignment 2, but could definitely be improved with the addition of team-work stratergies. The work was done in an appropriate manner that was according to our group discussion on assignment release. From first contact, the group had in combination a plethera of different personalities ranging from cultures, interests etc however, as we started working as a group, the level of diversity became irrelevant and we started to work with communicate with each other effectively. With regards to changes for assignment 3, we're going to be improving our means of workflow communication with the inclusion of a milestone plan indicating when work should be completed, the dependencies, resources (people working on the project) etc, which should allow for a more planned workflow for the group during Assignment 3. </p>
							<p>My career plan includes wanting to learn and become a IT Systems Engineer. Being a System Engineer requires me to interract with customers and constantly receive feedback according to the progress and ideas presented to clients. And so, in order to gain these skills, in my career plan, Iâ€™d need to think of gaining prior communication skills through a part-time customer service or similar job to facilitate this need. This is similar to all of the roles in our group. As a Software Engineer, an Infrastructure Manager, a Database Administrator and a Cloud Engineer will require the ability to provide constant communication with their clients in order to ensure the product delivery meets the standards of the client. My role is different from others, as the role of my job is to ensure the uptime, maintenance, installation of company systems for day-to-day productivity, including the planning of installation of the implementation of such infrastructure. Although, this is somewhat similar to a Infrastructure Manager, Systems Engineers do not handle staff, monetary issues etc.</p>
							<p>Trying to become a System Engineer, the role is diverse, which has some similarity and differences to each group member. My career plan might involve getting different certifications than many of my group members, such as a comptia+ etc which will be beneficial when finding an entry-level job such as IT Helpdesk, where as other jobs such as Software Engineers might need to be proficient in data science, programming etc. So, there definitely are similarities and differences that come with my career plan, where qualifications and skills I might need are completely different, so attention to specific areas may vary based on their each persons career plans.</p>
