							<p>My name is Dylan Fois, my student number is S3786185 and my personal email is dylanfois1@gmail.com. I was born in Melbourne, Victoria on the 20th of July 2000. My background is Italian as both of my parents were born in Italy. An interesting fact about me is that I play a few instruments, including violin, piano and electric guitar, and I use a computer program in order to practice on the guitar. In 2006 I started primary school at Brunswick South West Primary school, and graduated at the end of 2012. I then went on to Secondary education at Strathmore Secondary College in 2013, graduating in 2018 with an ATAR of 87.20.  I am now enrolled at RMIT University on the city campus, studying Bachelor of Information Technology.</p><p></p>
